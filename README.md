# Overview of the Microservice Template

Hereâ€™s a diagram illustrating the structure of this repository:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    DataContracts-->Host;
    DataAccess-->Host;
    Host-->DataAccess;
    Host-->DataContracts
```

This structure provides a clean abstraction across different components of the project.

For a practical example of how to use this template, check out the "example-usage" branch.

**Be sure** to update the root namespace to match your project's structure. You can use the appropriate rename-script.* file for your system to handle this update.
